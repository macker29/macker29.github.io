			<h2> Multiple Sclerosis is Strikingly Prevalent in Specific Demographics. Why? </h2>
		 <br>by: Megan Acker</h4>

		 <h5>  “MS is an inflammatory demyelinating condition. This means it is caused by damage to myelin – a fatty material that insulates nerves, acting much like the covering of an electric wire… In MS, the loss of myelin (demyelination) is accompanied by a disruption in the ability of the nerves to conduct electrical impulses to and from the brain.” - The Multiple Sclerosis International Foundation

		<p> For a disease that affects approximately one million Americans, and a reported 2.8 million people worldwide, Multiple Sclerosis enjoys quite a bit of anonymity in pop culture and to the general public. At least, that was my understanding before off-handedly remarking the latest research article I had been working on.

“Oh, my cousin was diagnosed with that years ago,” said my boss.

“My friend just got diagnosed,” one of my fraternity siblings told me.

“My aunt has had M.S for years,” responded one of my peers in class.

Apparently, someone from every aspect of my life knows someone who has M.S. But, if everyone knows someone, how come the prevalence of M.S seems so low? </p>

<h3>Barriers To Diagnosis</h3>

<p> According to <a href= "https://www.msif.org/"> Multiple Sclerosis International Foundation</a>, 83% of countries worldwide have barriers that prevent early diagnosis of M.S, with the most common one being a lack of awareness of M.S symptoms amongst both healthcare professionals and the general public. This barrier also makes it difficult for the MSIF to assess the global M.S population. In 2022, nearly 38% of surveyed countries listed “improved ability to diagnose M.S” as a reason for an increase in prevalence of M.S since 2013. </p>

<h3> Demographic Factors </h3>

<p> The 2020-2022 study revealed more than just gaps in diagnosis capabilities. It also found major differences in prevalence based on demographic. Perhaps most notably, it found that women account for an average of 70% of M.S diagnosis, both worldwide and here in the United States. 
	Researchers are still working to understand the reason for such great discrepancy. Some <a href= "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7160019/#S5"> theories</a> point to the difference in the gene expression of sex chromosomes in the immune system. Dr. Rhonda Voskuhl, a professor of neurology at University of California Los Angeles, studied the relationship and noted that while prevalence is greater in women, disability progression oddly is worse in men. Ultimately, her study concluded that there may be some relationship between sex hormones and M.S as well as gene expression, but that more research needs to be done.
Additionally, there is a notable relationship between M.S and latitude. “This is thought to be related partially to the amount of sun/UV exposure (which is less when you are further from the equator), especially during early life periods.” said Dr. Anne Helme, the Head of Research and Access for the MSIF. “For example, if you grow up in a country that is at a higher latitude, but then migrate to somewhere at a lower latitude, your risk of getting MS is similar to the country where you grew up.” </p>

</script>

<p>
 “This latitude effect is also seen within countries – for example, in the case of countries like Japan or the US, the prevalence of MS will be higher in the north of the country compared to the south.”
This analysis certainly holds true for <a href= "https://www.syracuse.com/health/2019/10/syracuse-has-highest-rate-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-us-study-shows.html"> New York State</a>. A 2017 study by Blue Cross Blue Shield found that the rate of prevalence for the state was 31 in 10,000 people, as opposed to the national rate of 24 in 10,000 people. Syracuse, one of the gloomier New York cities thanks to cloud coverage from the Great Lakes, has an astonishing rate of 45 in 10,000 people, one of the highest reported in the nation. </p>

<h3> The Importance of Access </h3>

<p>
	One of the few demographics that aren’t immediately notable in global data is class. While there isn’t a noticeable relationship between M.S prevalence and a country’s World Bank Income Level, Helme says this isn’t likely true on a micro level. “If individuals have to pay for their own health insurance or pay privately to access healthcare, then they will be less likely to be diagnosed, to be diagnosed at an early stage of their disease, and to have access to treatment and other therapies on a continual basis.” Further research published in “Multiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders Volume 40” indicates that lower socioeconomic class relates to increased disability as a result of M.S. Additionally, countries that have less robust healthcare industries due to lower incomes likely can’t track M.S as accurately, or diagnose patients with it as early. </p>

</script>
<p> And timing matters. According to a study published by the Oxford Health Policy Forum, early diagnosis is important to preserving quality of life for M.S patients and preventing relapses from occurring. Early treatment with disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) can help to slow disease progression. Additionally, the study corroborates data from the MSIF that there are very few healthcare providers that specialize in M.S treatment; both estimate that there are only .3 neurologists specializing in M.S per 100,000 people globally. Helme attributes this partially to the rarity of M.S compared to other neurological diseases, as well as to access to information about the condition. </p>

<h3>So What Are the Signs?</h3>

<p> According to the MSIF, “the most common MS symptoms are fatigue, pain, bladder and bowel issues, sexual dysfunction , movement and coordination problems, visual problems and cognition and emotional changes.” A person may experience one or multiple of these symptoms, as well as any other neurological changes. Patients are typically diagnosed between the ages of twenty and forty. It is important to contact a physician if you experience any of these symptoms regardless of your demographic. While M.S might be particularly prevalent in certain demographics, it can be (and is), prevalent everywhere.
